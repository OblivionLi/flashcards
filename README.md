# flashcards

#### A simple program that handles flashcards. Flashcards are cards that on one side you have a term i.e. "liviu" and the other side a definition i.e. "is a developer"; once a card was saved, the program can prompt the user to ask for definitions of N cards (terms); if the user makes a mistake, they will be saved. The program also keeps logs of all the inputs and outputs and also informations about the cards + their mistakes. These informations are stored in files.
